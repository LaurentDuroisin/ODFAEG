          * The sf::Events are stored into the leafs of a BSP tree structure.
          * It means that combined actions contains two children :
            -The first action child is linked to the first SFML event.
            -The second action child is linked to the second SFML event.
            -The combined actions contains also a pointer to a function who determine when the combined action is triggered.
            by exemple the xor function return true if one of the two action's children is triggered. (not both)
